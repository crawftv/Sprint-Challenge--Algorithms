#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)i think one runs in constant time. a1 is n^2. a2 is n^4.


b)the first for loop is n. the second is n/2. So i guess it's 2n which reduces to n time.


c)I think this is in n time.

## Exercise II

I believe this is the classic binary search problem.   
    STORE_TESTED_FLOORS = LIST  
    f = n/2  
    drop at f   
        if f in STORE:  
        return store  
        elif it successful  
            drop at f = (3/2)*(f)  
        elif it is unsucessful:  
            drop at f = (1/2)*(f)  
 I'm pretty sure the run time complexity approaches square_root of n
